            <p>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. While the goal statements themselves are concise, their full meaning and implications require deeper exploration. This document provides an amplified explanation of each goal, expanding on its broader context, interconnectedness with other goals, and transformative potential.</p>
            <p>Each amplification moves beyond the simple title to explore the deeper meaning, systemic changes required, and ultimate ambition of each goal.</p>

                        <p>This is about powering potential. It demands a global energy transition from dirty, finite fossil fuels to clean, renewable, and modern energy sources like solar, wind, and thermal. It focuses on making this energy affordable and accessible to all, particularly the billion people who still lack electricity.</p>
                        <p>This shift is crucial for combating climate change, powering economies, unlocking education (light to study by), and improving health (cleaner air and water). It represents both an environmental imperative and an opportunity for economic development. This goal involves expanding infrastructure and upgrading technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services, especially in least developed countries and small island developing states.</p>
