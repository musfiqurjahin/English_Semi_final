            <h2>Understanding the SDGs in Depth</h2>
            <p>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. While the goal statements themselves are concise, their full meaning and implications require deeper exploration.</p>
            <p>This document provides an amplified explanation of each goal, expanding on its broader context, interconnectedness with other goals, and transformative potential. Each amplification moves beyond the simple title to explore the deeper meaning, systemic changes required, and ultimate ambition of each goal.</p>

                    <div class="goal-description">
                        <p>This goal represents a fundamental commitment to eradicating all forms of poverty in all its dimensions. It moves beyond merely lifting individuals above an arbitrary financial line to address the systemic causes and manifestations of poverty, including hunger, homelessness, energy poverty, and social exclusion.</p>
                        <p>The amplification of this goal recognizes that poverty is not a natural state but a result of systemic failures in economic, social, and political structures. It calls for building resilient communities where everyone, especially the most vulnerable, has the rights, resources, social protection systems, and security to not just survive, but to thrive with dignity.</p>
                        <p>This requires implementing nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, ensuring equal rights to economic resources, access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, and building the resilience of the poor against climate-related extreme events and other economic, social, and environmental shocks.</p>

                        <p>This goal envisions a comprehensive transformation of our global food systems to ensure every person has access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food year-round. It addresses not just immediate hunger but the underlying structures that perpetuate food insecurity.</p>
                        <p>The amplification recognizes that achieving zero hunger requires sustainable agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, help maintain ecosystems, strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, and progressively improve land and soil quality. It emphasizes supporting small-scale farmers, particularly women, indigenous peoples, and family farmers, through access to knowledge, financial services, and markets.</p>
                        <p>This goal also calls for correcting and preventing trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets, adopting measures to ensure the proper functioning of food commodity markets, and ending the paradox of excessive food waste in a world where hunger persists. It represents a commitment to nurturing both people and the planet through sustainable food systems.</p>

                        <p>The amplification addresses major health priorities including reducing maternal mortality; ending preventable deaths of newborns and children; combating communicable diseases; reducing non-communicable diseases; preventing and treating substance abuse; reducing road injuries and deaths; ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services; and achieving universal health coverage.</p>
                        <p>This goal recognizes that health is influenced by multiple factors beyond healthcare, including environmental conditions, economic status, education, and social equity. It calls for creating societies that proactively promote wellness through preventive healthcare, health education, and addressing the social determinants of health, ensuring that no one's well-being is left to chance.</p>

                        <p>The amplification emphasizes safe, violence-free, and inclusive learning environments with qualified teachers, adequate facilities, and relevant curricula that foster critical thinking, creativity, sustainability, and global citizenship. It addresses the need to eliminate gender disparities and ensure equal access to all levels of education for vulnerable populations.</p>
                        <p>This goal also focuses on substantially increasing the number of youth and adults with relevant technical and vocational skills for employment and entrepreneurship, ensuring that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development.

                        <p>The amplification recognizes that gender equality is not just a women's issue but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous, and sustainable world. It requires ending all forms of discrimination, violence, and harmful practices against women and girls; recognizing and valuing unpaid care and domestic work; ensuring women's full participation in leadership and decision-making; and guaranteeing equal rights to economic resources, property ownership, and financial services.</p>
                        <p>This goal also emphasizes the need to adopt and strengthen policies and enforceable legislation for promoting gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls at all levels.

                        <p>The amplification moves beyond basic access to safe drinking water to include adequate sanitation and hygiene, ending the practice of open defecation that spreads disease and compromises dignity. It emphasizes improving water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping, minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, and increasing recycling and safe reuse.</p>
                        <p>This goal also involves protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems—including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers, and lakes—from degradation.
